Syrian Coin (SYR) Whitepaper
Version 1.0 â€“ May 2025

1. Introduction
In response to the ongoing economic hardships and limited financial infrastructure in Syria, Syrian Coin (SYR) emerges as a decentralized cryptocurrency aimed at empowering Syrians around the world. Leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, SYR facilitates transparent, secure, and censorship-resistant transactions to support financial inclusion, charitable efforts, and long-term economic rebuilding.

2. Vision
To build a community-powered decentralized ecosystem that provides financial access, fosters economic opportunity, and supports humanitarian relief for Syrians globally.

3. Problem Statement
Traditional financial systems are inaccessible to many Syrians due to sanctions, corruption, infrastructure damage, and lack of banking services. Cross-border payments are costly, slow, and heavily regulated, limiting access to aid and remittances.

4. Solution
Syrian Coin introduces a blockchain-based alternative:
- Fast and Low-Cost Remittances
- Decentralized Access
- Transparent Charitable Donations
- Staking-Based Governance

5. Tokenomics
Total Supply: 100,000,000 SYR (fixed supply, no minting)

Allocation        | Percentage | Tokens        
------------------|------------|---------------
Liquidity Pool    | 3%         | 3,000,000 SYR 
Charity Wallet    | 2%         | 2,000,000 SYR 
Founder Wallet    | 2%         | 2,000,000 SYR 
Founder Staking   | 10%        | 10,000,000 SYR 
Community & Ecosystem | 83%     | 83,000,000 SYR (locked, future utility)

6. Use Cases
- Remittances: Send funds instantly across borders without middlemen.
- Charity: Donors can verify on-chain where funds go.
- Staking Rewards: Community members can stake SYR to earn rewards.
- Future Governance: Voting rights for protocol upgrades.

7. Smart Contract & Security
SYR is an ERC-20 token deployed on Ethereum. The contract prohibits minting and includes clearly defined wallets for transparency. Contract Address:  
0xa7e21c9482dcc37af5f45715521209007372c828

Audits will be pursued in future iterations to ensure security and trust.

8. Roadmap

Q1 2025 | Token deployment, website launch, initial liquidity
Q2 2025 | Whitepaper release, Uniswap listing, marketing
Q3 2025 | Partnership outreach, staking platform, community growth
