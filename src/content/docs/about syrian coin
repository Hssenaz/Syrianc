## What is Syrian Coin (SYR)?

Syrian Coin (SYR) is a decentralized cryptocurrency built on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-20 standard). It was created to provide financial tools and opportunities to Syrian communities worldwide — supporting growth, transparency, and borderless value exchange.

## Our Mission

To empower individuals and organizations connected to Syria with secure, transparent, and accessible financial solutions through blockchain technology.

## Why Syrian Coin?
- **Transparency**: All transactions are verifiable on-chain
- **Accessibility**: Anyone with a wallet can own, send, and receive SYR
- **Purpose-driven**: A portion of supply supports charitable efforts

## Smart Contract
SYR is a fixed-supply token with no minting allowed after deployment. The token contract follows the standard ERC-20 specification for maximum compatibility with wallets and exchanges.
