Syrian Coin (SYR) Whitepaper
Version 1.0 â€“ May 2025

1. Introduction
In response to the ongoing economic hardships and limited financial infrastructure in Syria, Syrian Coin (SYR) emerges as a decentralized cryptocurrency aimed at empowering Syrians around the world. Leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, SYR facilitates transparent, secure, and censorship-resistant transactions to support financial inclusion, charitable efforts, and long-term economic rebuilding.

2. Vision
To build a community-powered decentralized ecosystem that provides financial access, fosters economic opportunity, and supports humanitarian relief for Syrians globally.

3. Problem Statement
Traditional financial systems are inaccessible to many Syrians due to sanctions, corruption, infrastructure damage, and lack of banking services. Cross-border payments are costly, slow, and heavily regulated, limiting access to aid and remittances.

4. Solution
Syrian Coin introduces a blockchain-based alternative:
- Fast and Low-Cost Remittances
- Decentralized Access
- Transparent Charitable Donations
- Staking-Based Governance
